# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sylwester, I live in Berlin and I like to tinker around with embedded hardware and software. Most of the time I am working on music / audio related project. Most of the time I am developing in C/C++ but I am also a GoLang fan.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
* PicoDSP, a RP2040 powered Audio DSP core
* P2040 powered low-power sensor board with 2.4GHz ISM Radio Transceiver
* A USB LVGL Driver for Ableton Push, Push 2, Native Instruments maschine series

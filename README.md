# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sylwester, I live in Berlin and I like to tinker around with embedded hardware and software. Most of the time I am working on music / audio related projects. Most of the time I am developing in C/C++ but I am also a GoLang fan. I used to be an IT systems administrator and DevOps guy for around 15 years, but feeling better in embedded soft- and hardware development.

Some of the technologies I've been workin on include FreeRTOS, ChibiOS, Buildroot, Zephyr, ESP32 MCUs, AVR MCUs, RP2040, ARM Cortex M0+ and M4 MCUs, MIDI, CAN Bus, RS485, ProtoBuf, MQTT, LoRA, low-power battery powered gadgets, and many more..

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
* XLink, a *secret* MIDI and Eurorack synth tool :eyes:
* [PicoADK](https://github.com/DatanoiseTV/PicoADK-Hardware), a RP2040 powered Audio DSP core
* RP2040 powered low-power sensor / actor board with 2.4GHz ISM Radio Transceiver
* A USB LVGL Driver for Ableton Push, Push 2, Native Instruments maschine series
